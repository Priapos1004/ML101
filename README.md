# ML101
This repository is created to help people to get started with Machine Learning and give some tips&amp;tricks for programing with python


# general workflow with machine learning
(1) data collection --> (2) data exploration --> (3) data preprocessing --> (4) train model --> (5) evaluate model ==> (6) create Prototype

## in jupyter notebooks
(1) data collection
- Kaggle.com
- client data

(2) data exploration - gain some information about your data
- NaN cells
- duplicates
- balance of target class

(3) data preprocessing
- delete/fill NaN cells
- handle duplicates
- upsample or downsample data
- convert text to vectors
- encode/scale/normilize features
